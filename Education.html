          Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
          such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character
          traits. These aims may include the development of understanding,
          rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the
          role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from
          indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an
          improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral
          definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may
          also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process:
          the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people.
          Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one
          generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly
          encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed
          for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills. Types of
          education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal
          education. Formal education takes place in education and training
          institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims and objectives,
          and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most regions, formal
          education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into
          educational stages such as kindergarten, primary school and secondary
          school. Nonformal education occurs as addition or alternative to
          formal education.

          The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to
          be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater
          development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it
          should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the
          power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management,
          corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country
          like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India
          spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the
          results aren’t actually visible…. We need to completely revamp the
          system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a
          21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list… For this, the
          first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting stuff from the
          syllabus, which almost 90% is irrelevant and students actually forget
          sooner or later and should be replaced with a practical and
          solution-centric approach to studies which will develop thinkers and
          leaders of tomorrow. I think the govt. is trying hard on this but it
          still needs to be passed quickly by the houses or else it might turn
          out to be too late.Practical oriented curriculum for all subjects
          could also be considered. Also, in the +2 scheme students should be
          very well allowed to study different subjects from any stream because
          in the 21st century no subject will survive in isolation, it is very
          much integrated hence no boundaries of ‘Stream’ should prevail…

        <p class="sectionSubTag text text-small">
          Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
          knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In
          pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through
          imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one
          generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge
          beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal
          education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the
          Middle Kingdom. Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the
          Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607 Plato founded
          the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in
          Europe. The city of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE,
          became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of Ancient
          Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the third
          century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy
          and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476. In China,
          Confucius (551–479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's most
          influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues
          to influence the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan,
          and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a
          ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his Analects
          were written down by followers and have continued to influence
          education in East Asia into the modern era.

          Education in India is a Concurrent List subject, that is both the
          Indian central government, and the state governments have
          responsibility for enacting and implementing education policy.The
          central board and most of the state boards uniformly follow the "10+2"
          pattern of education.In this pattern, study of 10 years is done in
          schools and 2 years in Junior colleges (Maharashtra) or Higher
          Secondary Schools(most other states), and then 3 years of study for a
          bachelor's degree. The first 10 years is further subdivided into 8
          years of elementary education (5 years Primary School and 3 years
          Middle School), 2 years of Secondary education followed by 2 years of
          Higher Secondary Schools or Junior colleges. This pattern originated
          from the recommendation of the Education Commission of 1964–66. There
          are two types of educational institutions in India, 1) Recognized
          institutions – primary school, secondary school, special schools,
          intermediate schools, colleges and universities who follow courses as
          prescribed by universities or boards and are also open for inspection
          by these authorities , 2) Unrecognized Institutions, which do not
          fulfill conditions as stated for the recognized ones.
